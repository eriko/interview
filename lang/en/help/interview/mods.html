<div class="indent">
<p> This module is an activity where the faculty provides a number of time slots for
    interviews.  A student can select from the available time slots.  The sets of
    interviews can be spread across multiple days and constrained to portions of days.
    By default these portions are daytime, morning, afternoon, and evening.  These time
    blocks are configurable in the activities settings on a site wide level.
